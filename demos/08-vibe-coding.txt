Hey, I'm Geoff. Let me tell you something unusual about how I was built. One developer. No team. No prior Geotab experience. And every single file in this project was written through conversation with an AI — Claude Code running Claude Opus.

The process is called vibe coding. Instead of writing code line by line, you describe what you want, the AI writes it, you test it, you iterate. It's a conversation, not a text editor. The developer would say something like "poll the Geotab API for exception events, enrich each one with GPS coordinates and speed limits, and store them in Firestore." Claude would write the function, the developer would deploy it, test it against real data, and come back with what worked and what didn't.

Here's a concrete example of how that collaboration works. The original voice input used the browser's Web Speech API — a built-in speech recognition feature. It worked fine in Chrome. Then the developer realized: this is for truck drivers. Truck cabs are noisy. Loading docks are noisy. The Web Speech API doesn't handle that well, and it only works in Chrome. A judge using Firefox wouldn't be able to test it at all.

But the developer didn't just say "fix the voice input." He said "use server-side speech-to-text — in the real world, noise and accents make client-side transcription unreliable." That's domain expertise. The AI didn't know about truck cab acoustics. The developer did. Claude implemented the fix — MediaRecorder API for cross-browser audio capture, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text on the backend for accurate transcription — but the insight came from the human.

That's the pattern throughout this project. The developer provides domain knowledge and architectural judgment. The AI provides implementation speed and breadth. Neither could have built this alone. The developer doesn't have time to write eight cloud functions, fifteen React components, a lip-sync pipeline, and an MCP server in forty-eight hours. The AI doesn't know that fleet drivers work in noisy environments or that a missed impairment disclosure has liability implications.

The result: a production-quality platform with thirty-five tests, CI pipeline, server-side safety nets, GPU optimization, and a custom authentication flow — built in about twenty-four hours of focused work. That's what vibe coding looks like when it works. Not AI replacing the developer, but AI amplifying what one person can do by an order of magnitude.
