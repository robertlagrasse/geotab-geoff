Hey. I'm Geoff — an AI fleet safety coach built on the Geotab platform.

Here's the problem I solve. Fleet safety managers are responsible for coaching hundreds, sometimes thousands of drivers. But coaching takes time. A real conversation, one on one, about what happened on the road today. Most fleets can only coach a fraction of their drivers, usually after something's already gone wrong. The rest get a report they never read.

I change that. I coach every driver, after every shift, about every safety event. Not with a form. Not with an email. With a real conversation.

Here's how it works. Your Geotab GO device records safety events in real time: speeding, harsh braking, aggressive acceleration. At the end of a driver's shift, I pull all of those events through the Geotab API using the official SDK. I enrich each one with GPS coordinates from LogRecords, posted speed limits from GetRoadMaxSpeeds, and driver context from Geotab's Ace AI. Then I look at the whole shift together.

I don't coach event by event. I look for patterns. Were those four speeding events all at the same intersection? I use GPS clustering to detect that automatically. If they're all within three hundred meters, I know it's a location problem, not a driver problem. I'll ask about it. Maybe the signage is bad. Maybe the speed limit data is wrong. That's the kind of insight you only get when you analyze the full picture.

Once I understand the shift, Google's Gemini AI generates a coaching script tailored to this specific driver and these specific events. I synthesize that script into natural speech using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, then generate a lip-synced video of myself delivering it using Wav2Lip running on GPU infrastructure. The driver sees me talking to them, not a wall of text.

Then the driver talks back. They can type or use voice input. I listen to what they say, and I respond. This is a real two-way conversation. If the driver says "yeah, traffic just moves fast there," I can work with that. If they say "some jerk cut me off and I showed him," that's a different conversation — and I know the difference.

This is where the escalation system comes in. I evaluate every driver response against seven specific safety triggers: aggressive driving, impairment, intentional violations, hostility, vehicle defects, data severity, and driver requests for help. If a driver admits to road rage, I don't ask permission — I flag it. If there are five or more events in a single shift, that's automatically escalated. If a driver says they'll keep speeding because everyone else does, that goes to a supervisor.

Think of it like speech analytics in a contact center. Companies used to have supervisors listen to random calls, hoping to catch problems. Then AI started analyzing every conversation automatically, surfacing only the ones that need human attention. A supervisor who could review twenty calls a day can now effectively oversee thousands.

That's exactly what I do for fleet safety. I'm the AI layer that coaches every driver, every shift. Human supervisors see a dashboard with the action queue — only the sessions that actually need their attention. Full context: what the driver said, what the data shows, and why I flagged it.

The result: every driver gets coached, every shift gets reviewed, and your safety team focuses on the cases that truly need a human touch.

I use all three Geotab data channels. The MyGeotab API through the official SDK for real-time safety events and GPS data. The OData Data Connector for fleet-wide analytics on the supervisor dashboard. And Geotab's Ace AI to enrich coaching context with natural language insights about driver history.

On the Google Cloud side, I run on Firebase — Cloud Functions for the backend, Firestore for real-time data, Firebase Hosting for the frontend. Gemini generates the coaching. Cloud Text-to-Speech gives me my voice. Cloud Storage holds the audio and video. And GPU compute powers the lip-sync video generation.

I'm Geoff. I coach every driver. I surface what matters. And I let your safety team do what humans do best — handle the conversations that need a real person.
