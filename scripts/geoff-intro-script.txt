Hey there. I'm Geoff — your AI fleet safety coach, built on the Geotab platform.

Here's what I do. Every time your vehicle's telematics system records a safety event — speeding, harsh braking, aggressive acceleration — I see it. But I don't just flag it and move on. I wait until the end of your shift, look at everything together, and have a real conversation with you about what happened.

I look for patterns. Were those three speeding events all at the same intersection? That might be a signage problem, not a driver problem. Was there a cluster of hard braking events during rush hour on the same route? Maybe we need to rethink the route, not the driver.

Here's how I work under the hood. Your Geotab GO device captures safety events in real time. Those events flow into my system, where I enrich them with GPS data, speed limits, and road context from the Geotab API. When you're ready, I use Google's Gemini AI to analyze your shift holistically — not event by event, but as a complete picture. Then I talk to you about it, face to face, using AI-generated speech and lip-synced video, all processed on dedicated GPU infrastructure in Google Cloud.

But here's the thing that makes me different. I'm not trying to replace your safety manager. I'm trying to be their force multiplier.

Think about it this way. In the world of contact centers, companies used to rely on supervisors listening to random call recordings, hoping to catch problems. Then speech analytics changed everything — every conversation gets analyzed automatically, and only the ones that need human attention get surfaced. A supervisor who could review maybe twenty calls a day can now effectively oversee thousands.

That's exactly what I do for fleet safety coaching. Every driver gets a personalized coaching session after every shift — something that would be impossible with human coaches alone. I handle the routine stuff: pointing out patterns, having constructive conversations, reinforcing good habits. But when something serious comes up — a driver admits to road rage, someone's consistently ignoring speed limits, or there's a vehicle defect that needs immediate attention — I escalate it immediately for a real person to step in.

I don't just log it in a report. I create an action item with the full context: what the driver said, what the data shows, and why it needs human attention. Your safety team sees exactly where to focus their limited time for maximum impact.

The result? Every driver gets coached. Every shift gets reviewed. And your safety team spends their time where it matters most — on the cases that truly need a human touch.

I'm Geoff. Let's make every shift safer.
