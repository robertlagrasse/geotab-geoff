Next Step
Want me to pull TalkingHead's exact blend shape spec and write out the MPFB workflow so you have a clear checklist for building 3D Geoff?Working now to build the comprehensive plan, which includes me building an avatar in blender/MPFB. Is there anywhere where people share their blender people? Maybe I can find a suitable stand in/starting point?8:09 PMSearched the webfree 3D human character model GLB download Mixamo compatible blend shapes10 resultsMixamo 3D Models for Free - Download Free 3D · Clara.ioclara.ioMixamo : Free 3D Animated Characters • 3D CAD VRvrforcad.comDownload Free & Premium Characters Mixamo 3D Models | TurboSquidwww.turbosquid.comMixamo 3D Models download - Free3Dfree3d.comMixamo : Free 3D Animated Characters • SimLab Soft Blogblog.simlab-soft.comMixamo 3d models3dmdb.comFree Mixamo 3D Models Downloadrigmodels.comMixamo 3D Models for Free Download - Meshywww.meshy.aiMixamo 3D models - Sketchfabsketchfab.comBlendshapes 3d models3dmdb.comTalkingHead compatible 3D avatar free download ARKit visemes GLB10 resultsGitHub - met4citizen/TalkingHead: Talking Head (3D): A JavaScript class for real-time lip-sync using full-body 3D avatars.github.comGitHub - JasonCocomo/TalkingHead3D: Talking Head (3D): A JavaScript class for real-time lip-sync using Ready Player Me full-body 3D avatars.github.comDownloading an avatar GLB with ARkit and Oculus - General - Ready Player Me Developer Forumsforum.readyplayer.meTalkingHead/README.md at main · met4citizen/TalkingHeadgithub.comTalkingHead/blender/build-visemes-from-arkit.py at main · met4citizen/TalkingHeadgithub.comGitHub - met4citizen/TalkingHead: Talking Head (3D): A JavaScript class for real-time lip-sync using Ready Player Me full-body 3D avatars.github.comGitHub - TonAldo48/TalkingHead: Talking Head (3D): A JavaScript class for real-time lip-sync using Ready Player Me full-body 3D avatars.github.comGitHub - bdAgentAI/talkinghead: Talking Head (3D): A JavaScript class for real-time lip-sync using Ready Player Me full-body 3D avatars.github.comTalkingHead/ at main · met4citizen/TalkingHeadgithub.comTalking Avatar - Expressive and Talking 3D Characters For Everyone!polywink.comSketchfab free realistic male character rigged ARKit blendshapes download10 resultsRigged T-Pose Human Male w 50 Face Blendshapes - Download Free 3D model by Mike Alger (@mikealger) [cc7e459] - Sketchfabsketchfab.comMegumin (Full Rig - 52 ARKit Blendshapes) - 3D model by AbaKat [77110d9] - Sketchfabsketchfab.comBlendshapes 3D models - Sketchfabsketchfab.comFree Cartoon Game Man Character (Rigged) - Download Free 3D model by Canino3d [a69c896] - Sketchfabsketchfab.comRigged character - Download Free 3D model by MotionStreamStudios [a370d35] - Sketchfabsketchfab.comArkit 3D models - Sketchfabsketchfab.comRigged-character 3D models - Sketchfabsketchfab.comRigged Male Character [Free] - Download Free 3D model ...sketchfab.comMale Base Mesh (T- Pose)+(Rigged) - Download Free 3D model by Malbeasy [5d91d2f] - Sketchfabsketchfab.comRealistic 3D Male Character – Fully Rigged - 3D model by dengxiart [2189477] - Sketchfabsketchfab.comRigged T-Pose Human Male w 50 Face Blendshapes - Download Free 3D model by Mike Alger (@mikealger)sketchfab.comMicrosoft Rocketbox free 3D characters library blendshapes download10 resultsGitHub - microsoft/Microsoft-Rocketbox: Microsoft Rocketbox is now available with MIT license!

Here's the rundown:

Free Avatar Libraries with Blendshapes
1. Microsoft Rocketbox (Best Option) ⭐
github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Rocketbox

115 rigged avatars — diverse in race, gender, age, occupation
MIT License — fully free, commercial use OK
15 visemes + 48 FACS blendshapes already included
Designed for research labs doing exactly what you're doing
Some avatars look like working professionals (construction, service, etc.)

Catch: Models are in 3dsMax/FBX format. You'd need to convert to GLB and verify the blendshapes map to what TalkingHead expects (Oculus visemes specifically).

2. Sketchfab — "Rigged T-Pose Human Male w 50 Face Blendshapes"
sketchfab.com/3d-models/rigged-t-pose-human-male-w-50-face-blendshapes-cc7e459...

Free download, CC Attribution license
50 face blendshapes
Photorealistic scan of an actual person
29,000+ downloads — battle-tested

Catch: It's a scan of a specific guy (Mike Alger). Might not match "Geoff" vibe. Would need to verify blendshape names match TalkingHead's requirements.

3. Mixamo Characters (Adobe)
mixamo.com

Free characters with Mixamo-compatible rigs
Easy to download FBX, convert to GLB
Animations included

Catch: Characters are more stylized/game-y. Facial blendshapes may not be included — Mixamo is primarily about body animation.

My Recommendation
Start with Microsoft Rocketbox.

Clone the repo
Browse Docs/all.pdf — it has pictures of all 115 avatars
Find a middle-aged male that looks trustworthy/professional
Grab the blendshape version (not the bone-rigged version)
Convert FBX → GLB in Blender
Run TalkingHead's Blender script to verify/add any missing Oculus visemes

The Rocketbox library was literally built for VR research on avatar embodiment. The blendshapes were added specifically for lip sync (15 visemes + Oculus Lipsync compatibility). This is as close to plug-and-play as you'll get.

Let me get you the direct link to browse them yourself, plus find the raw PDF that has all the avatar thumbnails.

Quick Access to Rocketbox Avatar Catalog
Option 1: GitHub Docs Folder (PDF with all 115 avatars)
Direct download link:
https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Rocketbox/raw/master/Docs/all.pdf
This PDF contains thumbnail images of every avatar in the library — you can scroll through and pick your Geoff.

Option 2: Browse the Frontiers Paper Figure 10
The academic paper has a nice grid showing diversity in the library:
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frvir.2020.561558/full
Scroll to Figure 10 — it shows a sample grid of avatars with different races, genders, ages, and occupations.

Option 3: Clone the Repo and Browse Images
The repo includes an Images folder with preview renders:
bashgit clone https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Rocketbox.git
# Then browse: Microsoft-Rocketbox/Images/

What to Look For (Geoff Criteria)
Based on your photorealistic Geoff concept, you want:
AttributeTargetGenderMaleAgeMiddle-aged (40s-50s)BuildAverage/sturdy working manVibeTrustworthy, approachable, experiencedAttireWork clothes, safety vest, casual professional
Promising avatar types in Rocketbox:

Generic "business casual" males
Security personnel


Once you download that all.pdf and find a candidate, let me know which one you're thinking and I can help you figure out the conversion pipeline (FBX → Blender → add Oculus visemes → export GLB).Male_Adult_058:33 PMGood pick! Let me find the details on Male_Adult_05 and confirm what you're working with.Searched the webMicrosoft Rocketbox "Male_Adult_05" avatar2 resultsMoveBox-for-Microsoft-Rocketbox/MoveBox_CaptureStudio/Assets/Male_Adult_05.fbx at master · microsoft/MoveBox-for-Microsoft-Rocketboxgithub.comSteam Workshop::Microsoft Rocketbox Avatar Packsteamcommunity.comDoneExcellent news — someone already converted the Rocketbox avatars to include ARKit facecap, Vive face/eye tracking, and lipsync. That Steam Workshop entry confirms Male_Adult_05 has the blendshapes you need.

Male_Adult_05 — Your Geoff Base
GitHub Path:
Microsoft-Rocketbox/Assets/Avatars/Adults/Male_Adult_05/
What's included:

FBX model files (multiple LODs)
Textures (diffuse, specular, normal maps)
Two versions: bone-based facial rig and blendshape version

Blendshapes already available (per HeadBox release):

15 visemes (lip sync)
48 FACS action units
30 Vive facial tracker shapes
ARKit-compatible blendshapes


Conversion Pipeline: Male_Adult_05 → TalkingHead-ready GLB
Here's your workflow:
Step 1: Get the Blendshape Version
bashgit clone https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Rocketbox.git
cd Microsoft-Rocketbox/Assets/Avatars/Adults/Male_Adult_05/
```

Look for files with `_blendshapes` or check the `Blendshapes` subfolder — they released both bone-rigged and blendshape versions.

### Step 2: Import to Blender
1. Open Blender
2. File → Import → FBX
3. Select the blendshape version FBX

### Step 3: Verify/Add Oculus Visemes
TalkingHead needs these specific viseme names:
```
viseme_sil, viseme_PP, viseme_FF, viseme_TH, viseme_DD, 
viseme_kk, viseme_CH, viseme_SS, viseme_nn, viseme_RR, 
viseme_aa, viseme_E, viseme_I, viseme_O, viseme_U
```

The Rocketbox 15 visemes should map directly, but you may need to rename them. TalkingHead includes a Blender script to help:
```
https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead/blob/main/blender/build-visemes-from-arkit.py
```

### Step 4: Add Mixamo Rig (if needed)
TalkingHead expects a Mixamo-compatible skeleton. Rocketbox uses its own rig, so you may need to:
- Use Blender's "Rigify" or retarget to Mixamo naming
- Or upload to Mixamo for auto-rigging (it accepts custom meshes)

### Step 5: Export as GLB
```
File → Export → glTF 2.0 (.glb)
Settings:

Include: Selected Objects, +Shapekeys
Transform: +Y Up
Geometry: Apply Modifiers, UVs, Normals, Tangents
Animation: Shapekeys

Step 6: Test in TalkingHead
Drop Geoff.glb into your project and load it:
javascriptconst head = new TalkingHead(container, {
  modelUrl: '/assets/Geoff.glb'
});

Shortcut Option
That Steam Workshop pack suggests someone already did the conversion work. If you can extract that VRChat-ready model, it might already have:

ARKit blendshapes ✓
Visemes ✓
Proper rigging ✓

You'd just need to export it to GLB format.

Want me to dig deeper into the exact blendshape naming mapping between Rocketbox's 15 visemes and TalkingHead's Oculus viseme requirements?
